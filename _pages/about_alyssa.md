My work is situated at the intersection of professional practice, worker-centered design, and organizational studies. Together with industry partners, local government, and students, we evaluate the realities of organizations and workplace practices to develop technologies for the future of work(ers).

I leverage my PhD in Human Centered Computing and role as Vice President of User Research at Ipsos North America to balance organizational goals with user wants and needs during the design process.

As a result, I engage with a number of different domains including: Designing Interactive Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Management of Information Systems.
