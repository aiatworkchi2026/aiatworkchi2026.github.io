We invite **500-word position statements** (excluding unlimited reference pages) that unpack a specific example of where tensions, conflict, or challenges are happening with AI deployment and use within organizational structures. We encourage submissions from all fields and perspectives, particularly those that offer a critical or reflective lens.

In addition to your paper, we ask all participants to share (and bring) **one artifact** for a *show and tell* session that will form a digital museum. This could be:

- **A historical artifact**: a photo, document, or object related to a past technological disruption that parallels current AI challenges (e.g., punch cards, the PC, or early automation).  
- **A contemporary artifact**: a screenshot of a challenging UI, a flowchart of a broken workflow, an email chain of an AI-related conflict, a photo of a whiteboard from a failed AI project, a screenshot of a social media post depicting an AI challenge, or an image of an AI-generated artifact that highlights a tension.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on (but not limited to) the following themes:

- **Case studies** of AI systems that created unexpected friction or conflict within an organization, or of worker efforts to shape, resist, or negotiate how AI systems are adopted and used.  
- **The changing nature of work**: how AI is redefining roles, skills, and hierarchies.  
- **Power dynamics**: how the introduction of AI can create new forms of control, surveillance, or inequality.  
- **Organizational culture**: the role of trust, resistance, and change management in AI adoption.  
- **Ethical tensions**: debates around accountability, bias, and transparency in an organizational context.  
- **Methodologies for deployment**: successful and unsuccessful approaches to co-designing and implementing AI with employees.  
- **Historical reflections**: drawing parallels between past technological disruptions and current AI challenges.
