# AI at Work: Negotiating Power, Roles, and Responsibility in Organizations

As AI systems become more integrated into daily work, they are no longer just tools, but active agents that reshape professional roles and responsibilities, communication channels, and power dynamics. While much research has focused on the technical development of AI, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of how these systems are adopted, resisted, and negotiated within the complexities of organizational life. 

A focus on organizational contexts highlights how AI systems reconfigure work at levels beyond individuals' experiences, but are also influenced by broader organizational processes and practices. Often, the promise of increased efficiency clashes with the reality of employee anxieties, unintended consequences, and the need to redesign core business processes. 

In our workshop, we seek to foster a dialogue about these socio-technical challenges, examining how different organizational structures and cultures mediate the impact of AI. By sharing real-world examples and historical precedents, we can learn from past mistakes and collaboratively envision futures for human-AI collaboration in the workplace.

## Workshop Format

Our long-format workshop (3 hrs) will provide a crucial venue for academic, industry, and public sector researchers to come together and discuss the lived experiences of deploying and reflecting on AI within real-world organizations. 

We will move beyond the technical capabilities of AI to explore the social, political, and cultural tensions that emerge when these technologies are introduced into the workplace. 

To facilitate a highly interactive workshop session, we are asking participants to submit position statements and an artifact representing a technological transformation in the workplace, modern or historical. 

The collection of artifacts will be curated and shared as a digital museum via our GitHub website with the ultimate goal of publishing our digital artifact museum as a part of an *Interactions* article.
