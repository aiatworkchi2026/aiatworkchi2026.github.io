As a Bullard Research Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin’s iSchool, I explore the ethical and human-centered design of AI systems, with a particular focus on explainability, trust, and human-AI collaboration. My work integrates human-computer interaction (HCI), AI ethics, and behavioral science to advance AI systems that not only enhance human capabilities but also promote responsible and community-driven innovation.

My research aligns closely with the mission of Good Systems, where I examine the unintended consequences of AI deployment, ensuring that AI systems are designed for societal benefit while mitigating potential risks. In addition, I am also engaged with the Cosmic AI Institute, where I explore how trustworthy, interpretable AI methods can support scientific discovery in astronomy. I am particularly interested in AI’s role in broadening access to scientific knowledge through open-source tools, data sharing, and educational initiatives.
