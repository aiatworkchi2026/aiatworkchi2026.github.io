# Workshop Program

Our workshop will be highly interactive, structured around a series of collaborative activities, designed to generate rich discussion and tangible outcomes that will inform our **playbook**.

---

## Show and Tell (30 minutes)

As a part of our introductions, participants will be asked to share the artifacts they brought and why.  
*Live sketching will occur during this session.*

---

## AI Deployment Dilemmas (40 minutes)

Building on the "Show and Tell," participants will break out into small groups. Each group will be given a specific AI deployment scenario. These scenarios present core ethical or organizational dilemmas, which groups will unpack and propose solutions for.  

*Group Shareout will follow this activity.*

---

## Journey Mapping (45 minutes)

In their small groups, participants will journey map the lifecycle of an AI system from ideation to deployment and maintenance. The goal is to identify and visually represent the key tension points, stakeholder conflicts, and unexpected challenges at each stage.

---

## Break (15 minutes)

---

## Playbook Prototyping (45 minutes)

Using insights from the previous activities, each small group will begin to prototype a single "chapter" or section of a collaborative AI adoption playbook. This will focus on a specific recommendation, a key principle, or a set of guiding questions for organizations.

---

## Collective Synthesis & Discussion (45 minutes)

Groups will share their playbook prototypes with the wider workshop. The focus will be on cross-pollination,refining initial ideas, and identifying common themes and shared challenges that emerged throughout the day.
